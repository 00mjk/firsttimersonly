### Welcome! Let's do some Open Source!
Contributing to open source for the first time can be scary and a little overwhelming. Perhaps you're a [Code Newbie](http://www.codenewbie.org) or maybe you've been coding for a while but haven't found a project you felt comfortable contributing to.


### You can do it! Here's how.
If you have never contributed to an open source project before and you're just getting started, consider exploring these resources.

* [http://up-for-grabs.net](http://up-for-grabs.net) is a site that aggregates (rolls up and makes easy to explore) projects that actively *want* help. They label those projects with things like "up-for-grabs," "jump-in" or "help wanted." 
* Read blog posts and guides on how to [contribute to an open source project](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/GetInvolvedInOpenSourceTodayHowToContributeAPatchToAGitHubHostedOpenSourceProjectLikeCode52.aspx), then pick one!
* If you're just getting started with tech and are considering being a social developer, we've made a documentary training movie for you! [Get Involved in Tech](http://www.getinvolvedintech.com) walks you through setting up your GitHub account, exploring StackOverflow, setting up a blog and starting to tweet!
* We think that Open Source projects [should value civility and kindness and be patient with new deveopers](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BringKindnessBackToOpenSource.aspx) and we encourage you to explore projects that have a published [Code of Conduct](http://contributor-covenant.org/) and we hope you do too!

### Are you an OSS Project Owner?
If you are an OSS (Open Source Software) Project owner, then consider marking a few open issues with the label [first-timers-only](https://github.com/search?q=label%3Afirst-timers-only). The `first-timers-only` label excpliciltly announces: 
> "I'm willing to hold your hand so you can make your first PR. This issue is is rather a bit easier than normal." 
  
Most importantly, anyone who's already contributed to open source isn't allowed to touch this one!

First timer contributions are normally very small and easy (One recent `first-timers-only` issue was literally 10 characters or so!) But this makes it easier for the contributor to _get the hang of the contribution process rather than the contribution itself._

Why is YAL (yet another label) like `first-timers-only` important? Because is makes a statement that first timers are welcome, that they are valued, and that they can start on your project! Often [the hard part of getting into open source for the first time isnâ€™t the implementation of a feature, but figuring out how to actually contribute code](https://medium.com/@kentcdodds/first-timers-only-78281ea47455) such that the pull request is accepted! But, oh the feelingn of accomplishment when your first PR is merged!

Go label an issue or two with `first-timers-only` and *advertise that those issues exist! Walka newvie a week (or a month) through the process! Document the process, blog and tweet about it and encourage those first timers to do the same!

### Empower a First Timer today!
We believe - and we hope you do too - that learning how to code, how to think, *and* _how to contribute to open source_ are can empower the next generation of coders and creatord. We VALUE first time contibutors and we want them to know that everyone started somewhere! Start here!
